The name of my project is myBlog. It is a simple full stack mern project blog project. It implements all the basic things you can do within a blog webiste.
This includes register a profile to be able to make a post, as well, see other people post they made for the day.
You can also delete or edit your post at anytime. it's also mobile and tablet friendly. I built this project to teach myself how to build a full stack
application and thought it would be interesting project to learn it.
